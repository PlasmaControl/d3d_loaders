D3D Loaders
===========

Implements data loader for D3D data. The loader itself is targeted to load data from the HDF5
files compiled in /projects/EKOLEMEN/aza_lenny_data1. Its structure is copied off of Pytorch's
[Iterable Datasets](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.IterableDataset)
